## Development

This Ludum Dare I wanted to try using Unitys upcoming “Data Oriented Tech Stack”. This means the game can easily handle thousands of physics objects. The drawbacks are that the scope is more limited than originally envisioned *and* that I’m unable to do a WebGL build (multithreading not yet supported by WebAssembly).

### Tools Used

- Unity
- Visual Studio Code
- Blender
- Inkscape
- Abundant Music
- Audacity
